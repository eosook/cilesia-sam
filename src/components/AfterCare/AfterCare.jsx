        Prebook your fills and secure the dates and times that work best for
        you! There must be 50% lashes remaining to be considered a fill. Most
        clients prefer to maintain the fullness of their lashes by coming in
        every 2 or 3 weeks.

      <p className="care-section__body">
        Avoid water, steam, and sweat for the first 24 hours following your
        appointment to allow the adhesive to completely cure and ensure proper
        retention.

      <h2 className="care-section__title">Wash and Cleanse Lashes Daily</h2>
      <p className="care-section__body">
        Thoroughly clean your eyelashes daily to maintain clean and healthy
        lashes. Our aftercare kit contains a lash shampoo and cleansing brush
        specially formulated to extend the life of eyelash extensions, and keep
        them full and fluffy.

      <h2 className="care-section__title">
        Avoid oil-based products and makeup around the eye area
      </h2>
      <p className="care-section__body">
        Oils cause the glue to break down quicker than normal, resulting in poor
        retention. Avoid using oil based products and waterproof
        eyeliner/eyeshadow around the eye area. Do not use mascara or false
        lashes as this will not only affect the fluffiness of your lashes, but
        also cause damage to your natural lashes.
